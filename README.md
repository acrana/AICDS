# AI Clinical Decision Support System 

This project aims to develop an AI-driven Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) to assist healthcare professionals in decision-making processes. This repository serves as a learning platform to explore and understand various tools and technologies such as Python, SQL, and TensorFlow.

## Project Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to learn and experiment with:

- **Python 3**
- **SQLite**: Database management
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Machine learning model building and training
- **scikit-learn**: Data preprocessing and utilities
