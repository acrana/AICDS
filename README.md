# AI Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS)

This project aims to develop an AI-driven Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) to assist healthcare professionals in decision-making processes. This repository serves as a learning platform to explore and understand various tools and technologies such as Python, SQL, and TensorFlow.

## Project Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to learn and experiment with:
- **Python**: For data manipulation, analysis, and building the core logic of the CDSS.
- **SQL**: For managing and querying healthcare-related data stored in databases.
- **TensorFlow**: For building and training machine learning models that can provide clinical decision support.

By working on this project, I hope to gain hands-on experience with these technologies and eventually develop a functional CDSS.
